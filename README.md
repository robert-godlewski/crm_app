# Main Description
An online app that has a lot of todo list items and can set reminders for the user.  
The data on the table will be organized off of the date they are due (or when the task was created).  
A combo of both iCal and reminders on the iPhone/Mac.

Development code is running on http://localhost:8000/

Inorder for the application to work you will need to add in a project_key.py file for sensitive information like mySQL_password (string) and flask_key (string).  Put this file under flask_app/config/.
